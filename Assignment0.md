## Websites
1. **Portfolio - Andy Wei**

**What I found Interesting**
>I first stumbled on Andy's work via Instagram, where I was so captivated by his beautiful paintings I clicked on the link in his bio to see his portfolio website. This was probably the first website portfolio I ever saw and thankfully I bookmarked it so I could reference it now. The site initially seemed minimalistic, but on further inspection, small personalized details like the randomized custom brush-strokes that highlight the page navigation really help enhance the viewing experience. 

**Design**
>Very few text is visible throughout the site, which helps bring more emphasis to his work. On entering Andy's site you're greeted with a custom animated logo and page navigation functionality is only allowed after you scroll down and back up.

1. **Professional Website - Lucy Guo**

**What I found Interesting**
>Lucy is one of the most accomplished and impressive individuals still in their twenties I've come across. I found her when I was researching scholarships and found she was a recipient for the prestigious Theil Fellowship for which she dropped out of CMU for. Her site is relatively simple, being one continuous scroll down page that highlights her current investments and accolades. There is also an animated typing style heading which is fitting considering her background in software engineering. This level of personalization is something I hope to be able to achieve once I learn how to code my own site later this term. 

1. **Musician - Lil Soy**

**My Thoughts & Impressions**
>Eddie or Lil Soy is a student at the Juilliard School in NYC. I'm subscribed to him on Youtube and I'm fascinated with his livestreams because his level of understanding in beat-making and production is next level. His website follows the same color scheme as his Youtube channel and has a retro, oldschool aesthetic. The landing page is widget containing his Soundcloud. He's linked all his forms of social media, but even with no experience in web design I can tell his website is not as good as the Andy's or Lucy's. It's functional, but lacks the creative personalization present in the others.

## About me
>About ME
An incurable dreamer, hopeless romantic, unapologetic otaku, and budding storyteller. I'm a new transfer student here at Drexel majoring in IDM and minoring in Video Production. My hope is for my images and stories to have, at the very least, a lingering impact on someone, somewhere. 

>I’m trying to add as much value to this world as I can and in the past, I’ve taken time off school, using it to work through childhood traumas and finding what I’m passionate about. I’m a self-taught photographer and editor specializing in Lightroom and Photoshop. My photos have garnered over one million impressions on Instagram and I can be found @darkturns. 

>I crave working on the edge of my capabilities and being pushed further than I thought possible, so that I can rise to the occasion. I have never coded before prior to taking this class and in all honesty, this assignment has been overwhelming and stressful, but I'm determined to push forward and succeed. 

>Travel and exploration has been a big influence of my work and hopefully, something that will continue to influence me as I start a new chapter here at Drexel. My hope is by the end of this term, not only will I have a website I built myself that I can use to showcase my portfolio, but the skills and knowledge to progress further in coding.
